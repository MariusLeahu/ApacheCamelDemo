# Apache Camel Demo with Swagger

Sample project to show how to start an Apache Camel project with Spring Boot, Rest DSL and Swagger for API documentation.

Run:
```
gradlew bootRun
```

After the application has started, access http://localhost:8080 and you'll get to the Swagger page.
The Rest API is exposed on http://localhost:10000/api/v1/api-doc , so paste this URL in Swagger page to retrieve the API doc.

There is also SSH console enabled at localhost:2212 user/password.
